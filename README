This is a deliberatly simple red-black tree implementation in OCaml.

I did it as an exercise to better understand two wonderful papers:
 - "Red-Black Trees in a Functional Setting" by Chris Okasaki
 - "Deletion: The curse of the red-black tree" by Kimball Germane and Matthew Might.

This approach to red-black trees feels much more natural than "traditional"
imperative approaches (e.g. the implementation from Introduction to Algorithms).
